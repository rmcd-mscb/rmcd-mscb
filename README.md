# Hi there 👋

## BIO
Hi!  I'm an earth scientist that works on applications of geomorphology and hydrology.  I've enjoyed working on topics including: aeolian and fluvial sediment-transport, upland river hydraulics, eco-hydraulics, lagrangian particle-tracking applications of riverine larval drift and general dispersion, watershed modeling, and open-source gis workflows and web-services.  I'm also a software developer with experience in C, C++, FORTRAN, and Python.

## Education
* MS, Earth Science, University of California, Santa Cruz 1993
* BS, Earth Science, University of California, Santa Cruz 1990

### Recent work

I've been expanding my use of AI tools.  Initially Github Copilot, but more recently I've been using Claude Code to great affect.  Much of this work has been on existing projects such as GDPTools and FluvialParticle (see below).  But more rencently I've worked on some other independent projects.

* [netcdf-viewer](https://github.com/rmcd-mscb/netcdf-viewer) A Visual Studio Code extension that lets you explore and inspect NetCDF files (.nc, .nc4, .cdf, .h5) directly within your editor.
* [weather-ensemble-agent](https://github.com/rmcd-mscb/weather-ensemble-agent)  I wanted to learn how to code up AI Agents.  This is An AI-powered weather forecast analysis tool that uses Claude (Anthropic) to analyze ensemble forecasts from multiple numerical weather prediction models. The agent autonomously fetches data, performs statistical analysis, and creates beautiful visualizations to help you understand forecast uncertainty.

### Desktop applications
* Multi-dimensional Surface Water Modeling System:  Principle developer of Windows application for pre- and post-processing of computaional flow and sediment-transport models: [MD_SWMS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3078/).  This project is inactive and has been replaced by iRIC.
* International River Interface Coopoerative (iRIC).  Co-developer and designer of early iterations of the [iRIC application](https://i-ric.org/en/)

### Python Packages
* [GDPTools](https://gdptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A python package for spatial interpolations of gridded datasets to arbitrary polygons using area-weighted statistics.
* [FluvialParticle](https://fluvial-particle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  A python package for lagrangian particle-tracking.
* [pyONHM](https://github.com/rmcd-mscb/pyonhm_mirror) A python package provides and Command Line Interface for managing a set of Docker images used to run the U.S. Geological Survey Operaional National Hydraulic Model.
* [CSDMS BMI Applications](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/community-for-data-integration-cdi/science/coupling-hydrologic-models-data-services) A proof-of-concept study that applied the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) Basic Modeling Interface (BMI) to the U.S. Geological Survey's Precipitation Runoff Modelling System (PRMS).
