# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## BIO
Hi!  I'm an earth scientist that works on applications of geomorphology and hydrology.  I've enjoyed working on topics including: aeolian and fluvial sediment-transport, upland river hydraulics, eco-hydraulics, lagrangian particle-tracking applications of riverine larval drift and general dispersion, watershed modeling, and open-source gis workflows and web-services.  I'm aslo a software developer with experience in C, C++, FORTRAN, and Python.

### Desktop applications
* Multi-dimensional Surface Water Modeling System:  Principle developer of Windows application for pre- and post-processing of computaional flow and sediment-transport models: [MD_SWMS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3078/).  This project is no inactive and has been replaced by iRIC.
* International River Interface Coopoerative (iRIC).  Co-developer and designer of early iterations of the [iRIC application](https://i-ric.org/en/)

### Python Packages
* [GDPTools](https://gdptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A python package for spatial interpolations of gridded datasets to arbitrary polygons using area-weighted statistics.
* [FluvialParticle](https://fluvial-particle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  A python package for lagrangian particle-tracking.  
* [CSDMS BMI Applications](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/community-for-data-integration-cdi/science/coupling-hydrologic-models-data-services) A proof-of-concept study that applied the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) Basic Modeling Interface (BMI) to the U.S. Geological Survey's Precipitation Runoff Modelling System (PRMS).
